// Things to improve:
// - Think about the behavior we want for recursive calls.
// - Keep track of CPU time too by using ManagementFactory.getThreadMXBean().
// - Consider cheaper alternatives to LinkedHashMap (e.g., use list if few elements).
// - Consider caching recent call paths since they are likely to be repeated.
// - Return an object from push() that the caller passes to pop() so that we can assert stack integrity.
// - Consider logging errors instead of throwing exceptions.
