// Things to improve:
// - Think about the behavior we want for recursive calls.
// - Keep track of CPU time too by using ManagementFactory.getThreadMXBean().
// - Consider cheaper alternatives to LinkedHashMap (e.g., use list if few elements).
// - Consider caching recent call paths since they are likely to be repeated.
// - Return an object from push() so that we can have better assertions in pop().
// - Consider logging errors instead of throwing exceptions.
// - Consider subtracting buildAndReset() overhead from time measurements.
// - Reduce allocations by keeping old tree nodes around and using a 'dirty' flag.

/** Builds a call tree for a single thread from a sequence of push() and pop() calls. */
